Summary

The objective of the 'Transforming Sign Language using CNN Approach' project is to create a precise and effective system for recognizing Indonesian Sign Language (Bahasa Isyarat Indonesia or BISINDO) by utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project aims to overcome the communication obstacles encountered by individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing by converting sign language into written language. This will improve accessibility and promote inclusivity. Context

BISINDO serves as the primary mode of communication for over two million individuals in Indonesia who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. Nevertheless, the public's restricted understanding of sign language poses obstacles to effective communication in their everyday activities. Sign language translation technology has the capacity to overcome this communication barrier by converting sign language into written language. Objective

The objective of this project is to enhance the capabilities of the deaf community and streamline communication by creating a highly accurate and efficient system for recognizing sign language in BISINDO. The project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful machine learning technique that has shown promising outcomes in tasks involving the recognition of images and videos, such as sign language recognition. Collection of data

The project employs the BISINDO dataset sourced from Kaggle, which has been previously curated in the study titled 'Towards Classification of Personality Prediction Model: A Combination of BERT Word Embedding and MLSMOTE.' The dataset comprises essential sign language video data required for training and assessing the CNN-based sign language recognition model. Methodology

The main methodology consists of instructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to acquire spatial characteristics from video data of sign language. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) possess the ability to autonomously extract significant features from images and video frames, rendering them highly suitable for tasks involving the recognition of sign language. The project aims to assess the efficacy of CNN in converting BISINDO into written language, with the objective of developing a reliable and precise model for recognizing sign language. Approach

The project adheres to a methodical approach, encompassing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization. The performance and effectiveness of the CNN-based approach are evaluated by comparing it with alternative methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.

Usage

    Data Preprocessing: Prepare the BISINDO dataset by organizing and formatting the sign language video data.
    Model Training: Utilize the prepared dataset to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
    Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model by employing suitable evaluation metrics.
    Optimization: Adjust the model's parameters and architecture as needed to enhance its performance.
